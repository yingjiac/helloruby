# helloruby

To create a Gitpod workspace based on this repository, paste a URL similar to the below into your address bar.

If you plan to make changes to the code that you want to save (since you don't have permission to push your edits back to my repo), you should first copy the repository to your own account first by clicking the "Use as template" button.

Either way, paste a URL similar to the below into your address bar, where the URL of the repository you want to work on is after `https://gitpod.io/#`:

```
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appdev-projects/helloruby
```

If you want to, you can install [Gitpod's browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/20_browser_extension/) to add a button to your browser that will create a workspace based on any repository you are looking at.
